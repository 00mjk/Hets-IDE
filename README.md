# Hets IDE

Hets IDE is an extension for the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor.
It can display the development graph of an opened specification inside the editor and does this by integrating with the [The Heterogeneous Tool Set (Hets)](http://hets.eu/).

## Features

Display a development graph inside of Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements

Currently the extension requires a Hets server running on localhost port 8000 with the working directory on `/data`.
The easiest way to achieve this is by using Docker as described in this [pull request](https://github.com/spechub/Hets/pull/1868).
